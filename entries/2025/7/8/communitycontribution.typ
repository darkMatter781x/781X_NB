  As a high school team with members who primarily started vex in middle school, we have created a lot of connections with other teams throughout our time in VRC. This includes our contribution to the local and global stage of VEX Robotics.

  == Mentoring
  Shreyas and Neil have volunteered at ACP middle school (7830) for 4 years, ever since they graduated and started 781X. We have also scrimmaged with them in the past to provide driver practice. Andrew helps the teams learn more advanced coding methods, while Shreyas and Neil help them with the build aspects.

  Last year, Juliana and Andrew helped a Basha AMS teacher start a team (50250) for her school of which the two graduated from. For the most part, they aid them in learning and understanding coding practices while building and documenting their robot's design process. Andrew primarily helps with programming and build techniques while Juliana does notebooking and logistics/support.

  == Volunteering
  As a team, we try our best to volunteer at least 2-3 times a season at local competitions. In the past, our team has filled roles involving refereeing, field resetting, queueing, and checking in teams. For example, the week before the high school States Competition during High Stakes, we helped out at the middle school States before meeting up and working on our autonomous code.

  == Scrimmages
  Last year, we also dedicated time to planning and organising scrimmages with other highly skilled Arizona VRC teams we competed with in the past. These were held before both States and Worlds, so we hope to do this again this year as we all improved our robots as a result of guidance from each other.
