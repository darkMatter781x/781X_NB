      *Identify the Problem*
      Using the resources provided by VEX, we will identify this year's game, its aspects, problems, challenges, and possible solutions. Research also includes rules, elements, mechanisms, parts, and tools which we will use throughout the season.
      Problems will arise throughout the design process starting as soon as the research phase. After research, we will analyze possible robot options, and the problems that come along. Even when tuning, problems can arise, especially in terms of improving minor details.

      *Brainstorm*
      After identifying problems, one must brainstorm to manifest any ideas that they can. For example, any mechanism that could have a slight change of application should be included, because if there are certain implications with using certain mechanisms, then backups could be used instead.
      Brainstorming also includes diagramming future design of our robots, specifically as blueprints. This will include cad files through Fusion 360, drawing digitally and on paper, pros and cons charts and prototype mechanisms.

  This is one the most crucial steps in the process, because jumping directly to building usually ends in disaster!

  *Select Best Solution*
  Weighing all the options, we will select the best solution.

  *Build and Program the Solution*
  Build refers to the construction of the physical robot and the code. If the design is done correctly, there should be minimal problems. These problems often include overlooked areas such as friction on axles, motors and robot dimension restrictions.

  *Test Solution*
  Testing is the process of testing the robot’s limits in match and skills. Testing is an arduous process which often takes a lot of time and tuning to be completed. But once completed, it will be ready to be used competitively.

  Tuning is the process of making changes (often small) in order to maximize the efficiency of the robot or code. For example, in previous years, we tuned a flywheel by changing friction, compression, angle and feeding mechanisms to maximize its competitive output. For autonomous code, the faster the auton, the better it will perform in games such as Tipping Point and High Stakes where rushing is essential for the outcome of the game.

  *Compete*
  Compete means the final output of the robot when it is ready for competitions. After competition performance, the design process might restart.

  *Overview*
  Our research will start with game analysis so that we know what this year’s challenge is all about and that way we can identify the problems that we need to solve in order to have a successful robot. From there we brainstorm solutions to the problems and after deciding, we will design them in CAD. After we finish our comprehensive CAD, we will move on to creating the robot. Once the building process is complete, then we will move on to testing the robot for flaws and tune the robot based on these flaws. After which, the robot will be ready to be delivered in the competition. This is obviously a simple straightforward pathway, but in reality the design process will not be as simple. For example, after testing and finding flaws, the flaws may require creation or modification of mechanisms to work around them. If we go back to creation, then we might need to redesign in CAD to confirm that the mechanism should work with the shape of the robot, however this may require going back to brainstorming or even going all the way back to researching if it is really necessary.
