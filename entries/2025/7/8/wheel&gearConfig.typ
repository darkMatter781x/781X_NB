  When designing a competitive drivetrain for this year's VEX Robotics competition, it's crucial to carefully select both the gear ratio and wheel configuration. These two factors significantly impact speed, torque, acceleration, stability, and the robot's ability to interact with game elements and the field.

  = Key Considerations
  == Game Field Considerations
  - *Flat surfaces:* This year's game field is mostly flat, which supports high-speed wheel configurations.
  - *Barriers and obstacles:* If minor bumps exist, wheel size and ground clearance become more important.

  == Game Strategy & Movement Requirements
  - Frequent traversal between scoring zones
  - Agile repositioning for defense or descoring
  - Precise alignment for scoring
  - Consistent, reliable speed and turning control
  This year's strategy demands a drivetrain that is optimized for *speed, maneuverability*, and *quick response*, with enough *torque* to hold ground when needed.
  == Robot Weight
  - *Light robots* can use faster gear ratios and smaller wheels

  - *Heavier robots* benefit from torque-oriented gearing and traction wheels to prevent stalling
  = Desired Performance Outcomes
  == To meet this yearâ€™s game challenges, the drivetrain must:
  - Maintain *high speed* across the field
  - Turn and strafe quickly for accurate positioning
  - Avoid slippage or stalling during contact with other robots
  - Adapt smoothly to different gameplay scenarios

  There are many possible wheel and gear configurations possible, however only a few options are viable for a reasonable amount of speed and torque. The wheel and gear configurations that we are considering for this robot are of the following:
  #grid(columns: (1fr, 1fr))[
    - 360 rpm on 3.25 in wheels
    - 450 rpm on 2.75 in wheels
    - 450 rpm on 3.25 in wheels
  ][
    - 480 rpm on 2.75 in wheels
    - 480 rpm on 3.25 in wheels
    - 600 rpm on 2.75 in wheels
  ]

    [
      - Achieved by gearing down a 600 rpm motor cartridge with a *36:60 gear ratio*
      - This setup produces the *highest torque output* among the six available options, making it ideal for pushing, pulling, and defense
      - However, it also results in the *lowest rotational speed*, making it the *slowest option*
      - The speed and torque highlights its suitability for playing and resisting defense

    [
      - Achieved by gearing down a 600 rpm motor cartridge with a *36:48 gear ratio*
      - This configuration produces the *second highest torque output* among the six options, which also allows it to be viable for pushing, pulling, and defense
      - This configuration is faster than 360 rpm on 3.25, however it is *not much faster*
      - Similar to 360, where it is suitable for playing and resisting defense while being fast enough to maneuver the field
