= Goals
- Disassemble the old drivetrain and prototypes
- Remake drivetrain and main structural components according to the new CAD

Today, once the CAD for the new robot was complete, Neil started to disassemble the prototyping done in the last meeting to start the new design. This new design had a lower front brace, allowing the blocks to ramp up more easily. This new design was more centered on block flow, calling for one of the 3 drive motors to be flipped horizontally.
