 = GOALS: 
 - Bracing the Drivetrain 
 - Mounting Odom Pods

 == Odom Pods:
 The odom pod was built from 2, 2 inch wheels mounted together to a rotation sensor. The rotation sensor will provide information about the speed of the robot and its orientation, which is used in calculations to help get a more consistent autonomous by using odometry. Odometry has awareness of a robots positioning to help it follow a predeterimined path. 
==  Bracing the Drivetrain:
If the robot is able to twist and rotate, than bracing ifs required to give adequate strength to the robot. Cross bracing gives the robot adequate support to not only retain its structure and hold its own weight, but redistibutes loads from collisions. We added 2 channels spanning the entire width of the robot to brace it, while adding occasional boxing to prevent the channels from caving in.
